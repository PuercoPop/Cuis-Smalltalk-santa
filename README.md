This class performs an annual drawing of names, ensuring that certain rules are followed.
A family may decide to draw names at Christmas so that each person can receive one especially nice gift instead of many lesser ones. The tedium of obtaining a good drawing by "pulling names from a hat" inspired this program.

Get started by making a file of names. The name of each single person appears on a separate line. Spouses are entered on a separate line as Spouse1 & Spouse2. You will be asked for the file name when the program runs.

Rules for the Secret Santa name drawing:

Can not draw yourself
Can not draw your spouse (you will give him or her a gift regardless)
Can not have reciprocals (A draws B and B draws A)
Can not be a repeat of the last 3 years

Names can be drawn even if there is no history for "the last 3 years".
History is built by using the output to create a class method for the current year.
