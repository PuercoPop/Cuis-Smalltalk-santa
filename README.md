This class performs an annual drawing of names, ensuring that certain rules are followed.
A family may decide to draw names at Christmas so that each person can receive one especially nice gift instead of many lesser ones. The tedium of obtaining a good drawing by "pulling names from a hat" inspired this program.

Get started by making a file of names. The name of each single person appears on a separate line. Spouses are entered on a separate line as Spouse1 & Spouse2. You will be asked for the directory of the file when the program runs. Name the file "SSANTAinput.txt".

Rules for the Secret Santa name drawing:

- Can not draw yourself
- Can not draw your spouse (you will give him or her a gift regardless)
- Can not have reciprocals (A draws B and B draws A)
- Can not be a repeat of the last 3 years

Names can be drawn even if there is no history for "the last 3 years". You will be asked if you want to save the results of the drawing. If you do, it will be saved in a file named "SSANTAoutput.txt" for use next year. Each following year, the results are added to the end of the file as long as you specify to save the drawing results. In this way, history is built up over time.

Statistics are displayed below the drawing results.
